6th January,2020        JAVA QUESTIONS WITH ANSWERS               


1. What is signed and unsigned integer in java?
A. An unsigned variable type of int can hold zero and positive numbers, and a signed int holds negative, zero and positive numbers.

2. Output of a|b?
A. The calculation is done based on binary number system.In OR the combination of 0 and 0 is 0 and the remaining all cases result as 1.

Program:
public class Main
{

public static void main(String[] args) {
	
	int a=2,b=3,c,d,e,f;
	   
	c=a&b;
	    
	d=a|b;
	  
	e=a ~ b;
	   
	f=a^b;
		
	System.out.println(c);
			
	System.out.println(d);
		
	System.out.println(e);
		
	System.out.println(f);

	    
	
	}

}

Output : 2 3 2 1

3. Can float,boolean,double be passed to a switch statement?
A.A switch works with the  enumerated types  the String class, and  primitive types: Character, Byte, Short, and Integer.
  The switch statement doesn't accept arguments of type long, float, double,boolean or any object besides String.
  Java does not support Boolean, float and double due to imprecise calculation.


4. When can the shift operators be uThe shift operator is used when you're performing logical bits operations, as opposed to mathematical operations.
A.The shift operator is used when you're performing logical bits operations, as opposed to mathematical operations.
It can be used for speed, being significantly faster than division/multiplication when dealing with operands that are powers of two, but clarity of code is usually preferred over raw speed.

5.Line Spacing..?
A.Java programs without a GUI uses a command line to interact with the user.The output must be properly formatted and spaced so that it is intelligble to the user.

6.Class Resolution
A.All symbolic references that were now loaded into the method area in form of the runtime constant pool are resolved to actual types loaded by this JVM. If a symbolic reference can be resolved but results in a conflict of definitions.

7.What is mosaic?
A.NCSA Mosaic, or simply Mosaic, is the web browser that popularized the World Wide Web and the Internet. It was also a client for earlier internet protocols such as File Transfer Protocol, Network News Transfer Protocol, and Gopher. The browser was named for its support of multiple internet protocols.

8.What is unsigned and signed integer ?
Unsigned: It consists of only non-negative values i.e 0 to 255.
Signed: It consist of both negative and positive values
but in different formats like
a. 0 to +127
b. -1 to -128
And this is about the 8-bit number system.

9.Difference between switch and if-else .
   •If statement selects the execution of the statements based upon the evaluation of the expression in if statements.
   •If else is good for variable conditions that results into a Boolean.
   •The switch statements selects the execution of the statement often based on a keyboard commands.
   •Switch statements are good for fixed data values.


10.Difference b/w scripting and programming?
A.
Factor       		Scripting Language			Programming Language
Type of language	Interpreter based			Compiler based
Usage			To combine existing components		To develop from scratch
Running			Inside other program (dependent)	Independent of a parent program
Conversion		High level to Machine Level		Full program converted to machine language in one time
Design			Makes coding simple and fast		Gives full use of language
Compilation		No need to compile			Needs to compile first
Complexity		Easy to write and use			Difficult
Interpretation		It is interpreted in another program	Stand-alone compile result, no need to be interpreted by another program
		
		
		
		
Example	JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Perl, VB Script, etc.	C, C++, Java, Pascal, C#, VB, Basic, COBOL, etc.



11.Difference  b/w strong and bold tags?
A.The difference between the two HTML tags is that bold makes text only visually look bold, while strong also semantically emphasizes the respective text as important and indicates that it is a meaningful word or text section. 
This distinction is due to the fact that HTML code differentiates between semantic-logical and physical-visual HTML tags. While the former refer to the meaning (semantics = theory of meaning) of the respective areas, the latter merely define the optical display in browsers. 
4.How to make a html page responsive using html?
Ans-By setting the viewport. When making responsive web pages, add the following <meta> element in all your web.
Example:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

This will set the viewport of your page, which will give the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.


12.Difference between block and inline element?
A.Block elements are those that take up the full width available on a web page, effectively blocking out any other elements from sitting next to it on the left or right. 
  Inline elements are those who only take up as much width as is needed to display the contents of the element, thereby allowing other elements to be in line with the inline element.


13.Program to find the largest number using ternary operator ?
Program:
class Ternary{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		int a=9, b=54, c=1, result, temp;
		 temp = a>b ? a:b;
		 result = c>temp ? c:temp;
		System.out.println("Largest Number is:"+result);
	}
}
output:Largest Number is:54

OR
 To find largest number without using< or > symbols?
public class Sample{
	public static void main(String args[]){
          int x=7,y=6;
		  System.out.println(((x+y)+Math.abs(x-y))/2);
	}
